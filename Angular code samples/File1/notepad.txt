Angular js 

>> client side js framework
>> Developed and being maintained by google
>> goals :
    >> Separate DOM manipulation from application logic(business logic)
    >> separation of concerns (using MVC like pattern)
     rest web services taken care by controller and that fetch to the model and model will present data to view 
    >> Make SPA development easier.
    >> Provide solid foundation for robust/enterprise -scale js client side applications.
    (almost compete with server side)
    >> Extensibility & customization 


Make angularjs available to web page 


>> download/refer "anguar-version-x.js" on your page

<script src = "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.3.15/angular.min.js"></script>

Creating angular module 

angular.module("sample",[]);
>> all application logic under one umberella
>> if second parameter it specifies that we are creating a new module
>> if not provided we are accessing existing module
>> empty [] indicates there are no dependencies

>>  decoratean element using ng-app and attach to module
EX:
<body ng-app="sample">
sum {{3+4}}
</body>

>> ng-app it is the root of angular application 
>> usually one ng-app per web page 
multiple ng-app can also be used 
>> can be attached to any html element 
>> ng-app is associated to an angular module called "root module"

use angular Expression to test angular js

like 
<body ng-app= "">
sum of 1 + 3 is {{1+3}}
</body>
