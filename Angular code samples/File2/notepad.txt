High level Overview Angular Process
 
 >> Angularjs is included and executed 
 >> Angularjs module gets created (if added )
 >> finds templates 
    >> Templates -- Html with some angular markup
             >> ng- attributes (directives)
             >> evaluating expressions 
             >> data binding markups 

    EX: <body ng-app ="sample">
		    sum of 1 + 2 is {{1+2}}
		    </body>


 >> Processes Template
   >> compiles template( for errors)
   >> loads templates (instance) in to the memory 
   >> transforms template with data 
     >> data binding 
     >> Evaluation of expressions 
   >> by this these template can be understandable by the browser and can be presented to view 
   >> angularjs works with the template and renders the output to DOM and can be viewe din the browser


Controller:
 >> controllers are Javascript objects which contains application logic 
 >> usually defined as a part of angular module
 >> 

 EX: 
<script>
 var sample = angular.module("sample",[]);
 sample.controller("emp",function()
 {
 this.Name= "harsha";
 });
 </script>
<body ng-app="sample">
<div ng-controller= "emp as o">
// controller emp is instantiated by o 
Hello {{o.Name}}
</div>
</body>

>> controllers allow us to send/receive data between DOM (say views) and application logic
>> Usually attached to DOM element using ng-controller attribute(directive)
  >> gets instantiated 

>> In other words exposes data(Model) to be consumed by views (one-way data binding)
>> if it also sends and takes data from the views (two-way data binding)
