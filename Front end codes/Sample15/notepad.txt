1) http status codes in restful web services
  200, 201, 202,
  3xx
  400, 401, 403, 404
  500, 501, 502, 503, .....
2) Angular JS --> MVC, MVVM (Data binding)


1))

2XX  codes are for success
200: OK
The request is succeeded this http status code is for success.

201: Created
The request has been fulfilled and the resulted in a new resource being created.

2)) Angular Js

  Angular Js is avery powerful JavaScript Framework, it is used in a single page web application projects,
  >> it extends HTML DOM elements with additional attributes to make it more responsive to the user actions.


  MVC Architecture :
  Model View Controller is popularly called as MVC architecture is a software design pattern for developing web applications.

  Model - is a bottom level of the pattern which is responsible for maintaining data.
  View - is responsible for displaying all or a portion of the data to the user.
  Controller - is a software code that controls the interaction between the Model and the View.

MVC is most popular because it isolates the application logic from the user interfaec layer and supports separation of concerns
here the controller receives all the requests and then works with the model and displays the data in with the help of view.


In AngularJs we use three important elements they are:

ng-app - this directive defines and links an angularJs application to HTML

ng-model - this directive binds the values of AngularJS application data to HTML input controls.

ng-bind- this directive binds the AngularJs application data to HTML tags.

>>AngularJs is a client side JS framework
>>it is developed and maintained by google
>> to separate DOM manipulations from application logic we use Angular Js
>> separation of concerns (using MVC like pattern)
Models contain data, views contain DOM html contents, Controller works with web services
>> Make Single page web application very easier.working on the same page like master page and use DOM elements and manipulate the data and get the data within the same page
>> we can create different modules in angular Js using

angular.module("example",[]);

here we are creating an angular module with a name example
 In Angular module all the application logic comes under one umberella
 and if a second parameter is provided ( [] ) then we are creating a new module.
 if second parameter is not provided we are accessing existing module.
 here empty [] implies that the module has no dependencies.

Defining the angular attribute:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

ng-app = "example"

here ng is the shortcut for angular application code
an Angular application really works with the module so we are defining the angular app with the module name example and it is the root module.

basically we have only one angular appliaction for one page but we can have multiple  angular application attribute with the modules

we cannot next the Angular application attribute can never be nested,
 we use different angular expression using simple snippets
 {{}}  it is a simple javascript expressions.
