1) Please practice all the filters and explain them by an example.
2) create a custom filter for reversing a string.
3) explain with an example about ng-repeat and ng-options. also look into diff between ng-repeat and ng-options.


1)) Filter
>> In angular JS Filters are mainly used to format the data, transform the data and search the data
>> Filters can be used in templates that is views, controllers and also services
>> we have two types of filters they are built-in filters (number,date,filter,uppercase,loweracase, orderBy)and custom filters

2)) we can reverse a string using custom filter

              countryApp.filter("reverse", function() {
                    return function(input) {
                    var result = "";
                    input = input || "";
                    for (var i=0; i<input.length; i++) {
                    result = input.charAt(i) + result;
                    }
                    return result;
                    };
                    });

      <input type="text" ng-model="text" placeholder="Enter your input"/>
        <p>Input Value : {{ text }}</p>
        <p>Filtered Value : {{ text | reverse }}</p>


3)) differene between ng-option and ng-repeat
>> ngOptions provides an iterator facility for the element which should be used instead of ngRepeat when you want the select model to be bound to a non-string value. This is because an option element can only be bound to string values at present.

>> The ngOptions attribute can be used to dynamically generate a list of <option> elements for the <select> element using the array or object obtained by evaluating the ngOptions comprehension expression
