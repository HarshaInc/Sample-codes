1) java script call apply bind methods? how to use them? what are the use cases when we have to use them?


bind:
>> bind method is used when u want that function to be called later with a certain context.
>> bind is used in events.
>> bind returns a new function and allows us to pass in a this array with any number of arguments.



call:
>> call method is used to call the function immediately
>> call invokes the function and allows us to pass in arguments one by one.


apply:
>> apply method is used to call the function immediately.
>> apply method invokes the function and allows us to pass in arguments as an array.


when to use:
call and apply are interchangeable, if we want separate arguments to pass it is better to use call method.
if we want an array of arguments to pass it is better to use apply method.

if we doesnt know how many arguments to pass and when the particular event would fire then we use bind method.
>> using bind method we can bind a variable with a function to create a new function.
